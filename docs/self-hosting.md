# Self-Hosting Composery

Composery should feel like a small Debian-style VPS in a browser: users can install
packages, edit system files, build projects, and keep that state across restarts.
The runtime is still a container, so persistence depends on mounting one durable
volume at `/data`.

## Recommended VPS Setup

The closest match to the production cloud runtime is:

- a Docker-capable Linux VPS, such as Hetzner Cloud CX/CPX or DigitalOcean;
- DNS `A` and `AAAA` records pointing at the VPS;
- inbound ports `80` and `443` open;
- Docker Compose;
- Caddy in front of Composery for automatic HTTPS;
- the systemd init profile on hosts with privileged containers and host cgroups.

Use [hosting/systemd-caddy-compose](../hosting/systemd-caddy-compose/) for this
setup. Use [hosting/supervisor-caddy-compose](../hosting/supervisor-caddy-compose/)
when the host cannot provide the systemd container requirements.

## Deployment Targets

| Target                                | Status            | Notes                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Docker Compose on one VPS             | Supported         | Use the systemd Caddy example when privileged cgroups are available; use the supervisor Caddy example for simpler Docker hosts.                                        |
| Hetzner CX/CPX VPS                    | Production target | This is the production cloud target in [Composery Cloud](https://composery.io/pricing).                                                                                |
| DigitalOcean Droplet or similar VPS   | Supported         | Same Compose/Caddy shape as Hetzner.                                                                                                                                   |
| Railway, Render, Fly, or similar PaaS | Supported         | Mount a writable persistent disk at `/data`, run a single instance per volume, and check `persistd status --json` after boot. Provider-specific setup is still manual. |
| Kubernetes                            | Manual            | Use one replica, a PVC mounted at `/data`, and an ingress/proxy. Do not scale one Composery instance horizontally against the same PVC.                                |

## Provider Notes

### VPS Providers

Use [hosting/systemd-caddy-compose](../hosting/systemd-caddy-compose/) on a
Droplet, Hetzner VPS, or similar host when you want `systemctl`, service units,
and journald inside Composery:

1. Point DNS at the server.
2. Open inbound `80` and `443`.
3. Install Docker Compose.
4. Copy the example and edit `Caddyfile` plus `composery.env`.
5. Run `docker compose up -d`.

This matches the runtime shape used by Composery Cloud.

### Render

Deploy the Composery image as a Docker-backed web service, attach a persistent
disk mounted at `/data`, and set `PORT=8080`.

Use the browser registration flow to create the initial password. Set `PASSWORD`
or `HASHED_PASSWORD` only if you want the password managed by environment
variables instead.

Render provides the public HTTPS edge, so do not use the Caddy example there.
Without a persistent disk mounted at `/data`, filesystem changes will not survive
redeploys.

### Railway

Deploy the Composery image, attach a Railway volume with mount path `/data`, and
route the public HTTP domain to target port `8080`.

Use the browser registration flow to create the initial password. Set `PASSWORD`
or `HASHED_PASSWORD` only if you want the password managed by environment
variables instead.

Railway volumes are mounted at runtime, so persistence should be verified after
the service starts with `persistd status --json`.

### Fly.io

Use one Machine with one volume mounted at `/data`. Fly volumes are local to the
Machine, so do not scale one Composery instance to multiple Machines unless each
Machine is treated as a separate box with its own volume.

### Kubernetes

Use a single replica, a `PersistentVolumeClaim` mounted at `/data`, and an
Ingress or Gateway for TLS. Composery is not currently a horizontally scalable
Kubernetes app because `persistd` is a single-writer daemon for one root
filesystem delta.

## Runtime Environment Variables

Composery does not define extra wrappers around upstream runtime settings. In
the Compose examples, set the documented variables in `composery.env`; the file
is mounted at `/etc/composery/composery.env` and read by the runtime. Other
hosting providers can use their environment-variable UI.

Most useful for self-hosting:

| Variable                           | Use                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PASSWORD`                         | Sets a plaintext code-server password and skips first-visit registration.                                                                      |
| `HASHED_PASSWORD`                  | Sets an argon2 hashed password and takes precedence over `PASSWORD`. Quote values containing `$` in `composery.env`.                           |
| `PORT`                             | Changes code-server's listen port. Also update Caddy, `expose`, health checks, or platform routing if you change it from `8080`.               |
| `COMPOSERY_INIT`                   | Selects the init profile: `supervisor` by default, or `systemd` when the container is started with the required cgroup and privilege settings. |
| `VSCODE_PROXY_URI`                 | Controls links in the Ports panel, for example `https://{{port}}.dev.example.com`. The default path proxy works without setting this.          |
| `COMPOSERY_DISABLE_FILE_DOWNLOADS` | Set to `1` or `true` to block browser file downloads.                                                                                          |
| `COMPOSERY_DISABLE_PROXY`          | Set to `1` or `true` to disable code-server's port proxy routes.                                                                               |
| `EXTENSIONS_GALLERY`               | Points code-server at a custom VS Code Extension Gallery API using the JSON shape expected by VS Code `product.json`.                          |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                        | Sets code-server logging to `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`.                                                                      |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`                     | Supplies code-server's GitHub auth token. Treat it as a secret; code-server removes it from the child-process environment after startup.       |

Accepted by code-server but usually less important for Composery:

| Variable                                                 | Use                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COMPOSERY_CONFIG`                                       | Overrides the code-server YAML config path.                                                                 |
| `COMPOSERY_HOST`                                         | Overrides the bind host. Avoid setting this unless you understand the container networking impact.          |
| `COMPOSERY_COOKIE_SUFFIX`                                | Adds a cookie suffix, useful when sharing a parent domain across multiple code-server instances.            |
| `COMPOSERY_RECONNECTION_GRACE_TIME`                      | Overrides reconnection grace time in seconds.                                                               |
| `COMPOSERY_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`                         | Asks code-server to exit after an idle period. Supervisor currently restarts code-server, so use with care. |
| `COMPOSERY_DISABLE_GETTING_STARTED_OVERRIDE`             | Set to `1` or `true` to disable code-server's Getting Started override.                                     |
| `HTTPS_PROXY`, `https_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `http_proxy` | Sets an outbound HTTP(S) proxy for code-server update and extension-related requests.                       |

## Persistence Contract

`persistd` compares the live root filesystem against an image baseline and writes
only user deltas to `/data/persistd`.

Persisted:

- regular files and directories;
- symlinks;
- hardlinks when the volume supports them;
- mode bits, ownership, and mtimes;
- xattrs, ACLs, and file capabilities, when supported by the kernel, mounted filesystem, and container privileges;
- FIFOs and device-node metadata, when supported by the mounted filesystem and container privileges;
- package manager state under paths such as `/usr`, `/etc`, and `/var/lib/dpkg`.

Excluded by default:

- `/data`;
- `/run`, `/var/run`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, and `/tmp`;
- `/opt/persistd` and `/opt/composery`;
- resolver and hostname files: `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, `/etc/resolv.conf`.

For the systemd profile, keep `/etc/systemd`, `/var/lib/systemd`, and
`/etc/machine-id` persisted. Those paths store enabled units, service state, and
machine identity. Excluding them would make Composery feel less like a VPS after
restart.

Unix sockets are runtime endpoints and are ignored even outside excluded
directories. The owning process must recreate them after restart.

When a regular file still has the same bytes as the image but only metadata has
changed, such as mode, owner, mtime, or xattrs, Composery stores the metadata
delta without copying the full file into `changed/`. This keeps a touched large
image file from ballooning the `/data` volume.

The active config lives at `/data/persistd/config.json`. Self-hosters may edit the
exclusion list. Invalid exclusion paths are rejected at startup.

## Operations

Useful commands inside the container:

```bash
sudo /opt/persistd/bin/persistd status
sudo /opt/persistd/bin/persistd status --json
sudo /opt/persistd/bin/persistd doctor
sudo /opt/persistd/bin/persistd prune
```

When running the systemd profile:

```bash
systemctl status composery persistd
journalctl -u composery -u persistd --no-pager
```

Readiness is exposed through `/run/persistd/ready` and code-server's `/healthz`
route. If `persistd apply` fails during boot, code-server does not become ready.

## Security

Composery is intentionally root-capable inside the container because it is meant to
feel like a mutable Linux system. Treat the browser password and reverse proxy as
the security boundary for self-hosted use:

- use HTTPS;
- register a strong password, or set `PASSWORD`/`HASHED_PASSWORD` for environment-managed credentials;
- keep the image updated;
- do not expose port `8080` directly when using a public Caddy/nginx/Traefik edge;
- back up the named Docker volume or the mounted `/data` disk.
