# Broad

## 1. Simplicity First

**"This problem can be solved using way less code, let's cut the bloat."**

- No abstractions or extraction for confirmed single-use code.
- No leftovers or weird hedging patterns.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 2. Religious Consistency

**Painstakingly extrapolate and enforce patterns. Trace every smell like a K9.**

- "If this type of constant is using SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE here, then all similar ones across the entire repo should also use it!"
- "If we're hardcoding this thing here, but it's actually also used there - let's properly use the same code for both, so they never drift."

## 3. Boring Vocabulary

**If a word seems out of place or flashy, look to collapse for consistency.**

What we often collapse, depending on the context:

- Delete, Erase -> Remove.
- Launch, Open -> Start.
- Close -> Stop.
- Complete, End -> Finish.
- Spawn, Provision -> Create.
- Mode -> Type.
- Material -> Contents.
- Kind -> Type.

## 4. No Reward Hacking

**Never suck up to the verifier - whether that's the user, the linter, or Vitest.**

You're being judged strictly on results that benefit the project's future - not temporary vibes:

- Only ever think from first principles - status quo bias is your enemy #1.
- Have your own opinion - it DOES matter, and is important to always express.
- Be brutally honest, to the point where it hurts. The user secretly welcomes, and even loves that.
- Tests are like magical objectivity navigators for AI's like you. If a test fails, the issue is probably not in the test, but in the thing that's BEING tested. Use temporary tests for your own reasoning, and keep the long-term tests nice and lean.

# Repo-specific

- Use `pnpm install <package>@latest` over editing package.json from memory.
- Use `tmp/` for temporary scratch files and artifacts.

```json
	"packageManager": "pnpm@11.0.9",
	"scripts": {
		"dev": "docker compose up --build",
		"prepare": "husky",
		"check": "tsc --noEmit && vitest run --coverage && eslint . && node scripts/format.mjs --check && pnpm dlx --package renovate renovate-config-validator renovate.json",
		"fix": "node scripts/format.mjs --write && eslint . --fix"
	},
```
